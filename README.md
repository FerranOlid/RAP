Rash Audio Player

This is a software to play audio stored in a file in a partucilar format. The file does not contain a serie of digital
frequencies which are directly played in the speakers, but instead it contains the notes and the tempo, which allows
people to compose music and play it at the same time. To be cooler, this software plays the music in a retro 8-bit
noise
